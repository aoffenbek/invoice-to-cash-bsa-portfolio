# Invoice-to-Cash Business Systems Analysis Portfolio

## Overview

This repository showcases an **end-to-end Business Systems Analysis (BSA) project** focused on the **Invoice-to-Cash (I2C)** process in a finance and ERP-driven environment.

The project demonstrates how a Business Systems Analyst bridges **business, finance, IT, and data teams** to deliver controlled, auditable, and scalable solutions.

Finance organizations often struggle with:

* Duplicate or missing invoices
* Inconsistent AR and revenue postings
